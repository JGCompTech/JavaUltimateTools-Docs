Link Java Ultimate Tools, or JUT for short, is a large powerful and flexible open-source repository for use in any Java program. Java Ultimate Tools Features Link OSInfo - Contains many classes that return information about the current Windows installation. This includes Architecture, Edition, Name, Product Key, Service Pack, User Info and Version. HWInfo - Contains many classes that return information about the current computer hardware. This includes BIOS, Network, OEM, Processor, RAM and Storage. SecurityTools - Contains methods surrounding hashing and encryption. Includes methods using MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512. Also includes encryption/decryption with RSA. CommandInfo - Allows you to run any console command and will return the result to a string to use within your program. You can also run the command elevated and it will open in a new cmd window and show the results. Note: If elevated, result cannot be returned as a string. MessageBox and Login dialogs - Dialogs to use in JavaFX applications FXML Dialog Wrapper - Class to wrap a FXML dialog object, reducing the amount of required code DatabaseTools - Allows communication with H2, HyperSQL and SQLite databases SQL Statement Builders - Allows for using methods instead of native SQL code to generate Prepared Statements User Account Management Tools - Includes User Roles, Sessions and Permissions Custom Event Manager System - Creates Events similar to the JavaFX Events but not using any JavaFX classes Utility Classes - Includes classes for managing collections, numbers and strings And Much More! Development Link Want to contribute? Great! Any help with development is greatly appreciated.
